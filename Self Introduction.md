[Un-reviewed]

Describe a challenging technical problem you faced in a previous role and how you resolved it.

-   Linedata >> SEG Research Dashboard and Portfolio Monitor App
    -   Live feed implementation for dashboard positions.
    -   Amongst all the options from GraphQL, Websockets, we ended up implementing a much simpler approach after understanding the use case. Saving effort cost and delivering before time.
-   Finalyca:
    -   On premise installation for an internal module/API to avoid sharing the user data.
    -   Refactoring is needed to enable componentization which will allow us to repackage our modules in a way where we can collaborate with different software.

Describe a people management challenge

-   Reduce in collaboration and productivity among couple of team members due to different working styles.
    -   I had to conduct individual and then group meeting to understand the issue, find a middle way approach. Then establish guidelines around the same.
    -   Sometimes had to perform pair programming.
-   Motivating team members
    -   Conduct one on one sessions. Appreciate efforts when necessary during team discussions.

### Product & Task Management

[](https://github.com/kamleshmj07/Interview/blob/master/Self%20Introduction.md#product--task-management)

What are the steps to build a product?

-   Conduct group or individual meetings with stakeholders to collaborate and understand project goals, scope, and desired outcomes.
-   Analyze and identify key features, functionalities, and constraints.
-   Prioritize requirements based on business value, technical feasibility, and project/technical constraints, ensuring alignment with the overall project objectives.
-   Translate to technical specification and execute implementation.
-   Take weekly or biweekly follow-ups/feedbacks and implement the feedback for continuous evolution of the product.

How do you prioritize tasks and allocate resources in a software development project?

-   Setup a biweekly/monthly sprint for planning deliverables.
-   Step 1] To prioritize your product backlog along with new requests/issues.  
    Step 2] Start to assess the business value of each item along with ballpark estimate.  
    + High user impact with high business value plus it aligns with realistic development estimate then >> Highest Priority  
    + Must have (essential) >>> Should have (need to have but not essential) >>> Could have (nice to have) >>> Won’t have ()  
    Step 3] Assess the bandwidth of team, based on skillset and priority assign the tasks.  
    + Set clear goals  
    + Plan considering the dependencies within the team  
    + Conduct quick short daily standups, obtain inputs and provide direction if necessary.

How do you communicate technical concepts and project status updates to non-technical stakeholders?

-   Assess the audience based on area of expertise and technical knowledge.
-   Translate technical jargons and use analogies.
-   Maintain and share a brief periodic project status report based on agreed upon template.
