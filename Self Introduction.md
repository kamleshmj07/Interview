<p><strong>Response to unexpected questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I haven’t encountered that specific situation before, but here’s how I would approach it.</li>
<li>My problem-solving skills and adaptability have helped me navigate unfamiliar situations in the past, and I’m confident I can do the same here.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>[Un-reviewed]</p>
<p>Describe a challenging technical problem you faced in a previous role and how you resolved it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linedata &gt;&gt; SEG Research Dashboard and Portfolio Monitor App
<ul>
<li>Live feed implementation for dashboard positions.</li>
<li>Amongst all the options from GraphQL, Websockets, we ended up implementing a much simpler approach after understanding the use case. Saving effort cost and delivering before time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finalyca:
<ul>
<li>On premise installation for an internal module/API to avoid sharing the user data.</li>
<li>Refactoring is needed to enable componentization which will allow us to repackage our modules in a way where we can collaborate with different software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Sometimes had to perform pair programming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Motivating team members
<ul>
<li>Conduct one on one sessions. Appreciate efforts when necessary during team discussions.</li>

<h3 id="product--task-management">Product &amp; Task Management</h3>
<p>What are the steps to build a product?</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct group or individual meetings with stakeholders to collaborate and understand project goals, scope, and desired outcomes.</li>
<li>Analyze and identify key features, functionalities, and constraints.</li>
<li>Prioritize requirements based on business value, technical feasibility, and project/technical constraints, ensuring alignment with the overall project objectives.</li>
<li>Translate to technical specification and execute implementation.</li>
<li>Take weekly or biweekly follow-ups/feedbacks and implement the feedback for continuous evolution of the product.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you prioritize tasks and allocate resources in a software development project?</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a biweekly/monthly sprint for planning deliverables.</li>
<li>Step 1] To prioritize your product backlog along with new requests/issues.<br>
Step 2] Start to assess the business value of each item along with ballpark estimate.<br>
+ High user impact with high business value plus it aligns with realistic development estimate  then &gt;&gt; Highest Priority<br>
+ Must have (essential) &gt;&gt;&gt; Should have (need to have but not essential) &gt;&gt;&gt; Could have (nice to have) &gt;&gt;&gt; Won’t have ()<br>
Step 3] Assess the bandwidth of team, based on skillset and priority assign the tasks.<br>
+ Set clear goals<br>
+ Plan considering the dependencies within the team<br>
+ Conduct quick short daily standups, obtain inputs and provide direction if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you communicate technical concepts and project status updates to non-technical stakeholders?</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess the audience based on area of expertise and technical knowledge.</li>
<li>Translate technical jargons and use analogies.</li>
<li>Maintain and share a brief periodic project status report based on agreed upon template.</li>
</ul>
