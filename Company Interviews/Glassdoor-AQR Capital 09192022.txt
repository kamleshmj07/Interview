Problem 1:
You are given two integers, p and q. Complete the function calculatePower which takes two integers as arguments and returns p to the power of q, without using the built-in power function. We expect you to do better than O(q). A same input is p = 2 and q = 3, and the corresponding output is 8. Constraints: 0 <= p^q <= ((2^63) - 1)

Problem 2:
You are given an integer array n. Complete the function sortIntegers which takes as argument, an integer array n of up to 1 million integers such that 1 <= n_i <= 10 for every element n_i in the array, and returns the sorted array. The sort does not need to occur in-place. Please do not call a standard sorting function like quicksort, you can do better. A sample input is {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5} and the corresponding output is {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9}. Constraints: i <= 10^9; 1 <= n_i <= 10

Problem 3:
You are given an alphanumeric string. Complete the function sortSegments that will segment the string into substrings of consecutive letters or numbers and then sort the substrings. For example, the string "AZQF013452BAB" will result in "AFQZ012345ABB". The input letters will be uppercase and numbers will be between 0 and 9 inclusive.
