What are types ofValidation controls in ASP.NET?
    RequiredFieldValidator validates compulsory/required input.
    RegularExpressionValidator validates input value against a defined regular expression pattern.
    RangeValidator validates the range. Validates that input falls between the given range values.
    CompareValidator validates or compares the input of a control with another control value or with a fixed value.
    CustomValidator allows to customize the validation logic with respect to our application logic.
    ValidationSummary displays all errors on page collectively.

Session state modes in ASP.NET?
    In-Proc is the default approach. It stores session state locally on same web server memory where the application is running.
    StateServer mode stores session state in a process other than the one where application is running. Naturally, it has added advantages that session state is accessible from multiple web servers in a Web Farm and also session state will remain preserved even web application is restarted.
    SQLServer mode stores session state in SQL Server database. It has the same advantages as that of StateServer.
    Custom modes allows to define our custom storage provider.
    Off mode disables session storage. 

State Management ? 
HTTP is a stateless.
(i.e. state of a webpage, a control or an object etc.)

1.  Client-Side State Management
