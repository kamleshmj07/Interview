>> What is DataStructure ?
	- A data structure is a special format for organizing and storing data.
  
>> Type of Datastructures
	- Linear structures : Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially.
	- Non Linear structures : Elements are stored/accessed in a non linear manner.
  
>> Analysis	of	Algorithms
	- For an application there are many important things like user friendliness, modularity, security, maintainability, etc.
	- Performance is like currency through which we can buy all the above things. Another reason for studying performance is â€“ speed is fun!
	
>> What is Asymptotic Analysis / Running Time Analysis ?
	- It is a way of performance analysis for given algorithm in terms of varying input size.
	- We ignore constants in this analysis. But this is the best way possible for studying performance for an algorithm.
	
>> What is Abstract Data Types (ADT) ?
	- To simplify the process of solving problems we combine the datastructures with the operations. We call this as ADT. ex: Linked List, Stack, Queues, Dictionaries.
