>> What is DataStructure ?
	- A data structure is a special format for organizing and storing data. General data structure types include arrays, files, linked
lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs and so on.
  
>> Type of Datastructures
	- Linear : Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially. (Linked Lists, Stacks and
Queues)
	- Non-Linear : Elements are stored/accessed in a non linear manner. (Trees and graphs)
  	
>> What is Abstract Data Types (ADT) ?
	- An ADT consists of two parts:
		1. Declaration of data
		2. Declaration of operations
	- While defining the ADTs do not worry about the implementation details.

>> What is an Algorithm ?
	- An algorithm is the step-by-step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem.
	- Mainly the efficiency along with the correctness matters for any algorithm.
	
>> What is Running Time Analysis?
	- It is the process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem (input size) increases.
	- Input size is the number of elements in the input, and depending on the problem type, the input may be of different types. 
	- The following are the common types of inputs :
		a) Size of an array
		b) Polynomial degree
		c) Number of elements in a matrix
		d) Number of bits in the binary representation of the input
		e) Vertices and edges in a graph.
	- The running time of a given algorithm is a function of the input size n (i.e., f(n)).

>> Rate of growth
	- The rate at which the running time increases as a function of input is called rate of growth.
		ex : n^4 is the highest rate of growth in n^4 + 2n^2 + 100n + 50
