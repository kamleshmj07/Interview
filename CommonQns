    1] I'm wanting better mentors and smarter people around me to work with.
    2] I'm wanting to shift to a culture where personal growth is motivated.


Day to day activity or Roles and Responsibilities:
  - Sprint planning and execution
  - Task management
  - Discussions with stakeholders for implementation
  - Code review
  - Individual contribution


Describe a challenging technical problem you faced in a previous role and how you resolved it.
  - Linedata >> SEG Research Dashboard and Portfolio Monitor App
      + Live feed implementation for dashboard positions.
      + Amongst all the options from GraphQL, Websockets, we ended up implementing a much simpler approach after understanding the use case. Saving effort cost and delivering before time.
  - Finalyca: 
      + On premise installation for an internal module/API to avoid sharing the user data.
      + Refactoring is needed to enable componentization which will allow us to repackage our modules in a way where we can collaborate with different softwares.


Describe a people management challenge
  - Reduce in collaboration and productivity among couple of team members due to different working styles.
      + I had to conduct individual and then group meeting to understand the issue, find a middle way approach. Then establish guidlines around the same.
      + Sometimes had to perform pair programming.
  - Motivating team members
      + Conduct one on one sessions. Appreciate efforts when necessary during team discussions.


--------------------------------------------------------------- Product & Task Management
What are the steps to build a product?
  - Conduct group or individual meetings with stakeholders to collaborate and understand project goals, scope, and desired outcomes.
  - Analyze and identify key features, functionalities, and constraints.
  - Prioritize requirements based on business value, technical feasibility, and project/technical constraints, ensuring alignment with the overall project objectives.
  - Translate to technical specification and exeucte implementation.
  - Take weekly or biweekly followups/feedbacks and implement the feedback for continous evolution of the product.


How do you prioritize tasks and allocate resources in a software development project?
  - Setup a biweekly/monthly sprint for planning deliverables.
  - Step 1] To prioritize your product backlog along with new requests/issues.
    Step 2] Start to assess the business value of each item along with ballpark estimate.
            + High user impact with high business value plus it aligns with realistic development estimate  then >> Highest Priority
            + Must have (essential) >>> Should have (need to have but not essential) >>> Could have (nice to have) >>> Won't have ()
    Step 3] Assess the bandwidth of team, based on skillset and priority assign the tasks.
            + Set clear goals
            + Plan considering the dependencies within the team
            + Conduct quick short daily standups, obtain inputs and provide direction if necessary.


How do you communicate technical concepts and project status updates to non-technical stakeholders?
  - Assess the audience based on area of expertise and technical knowledge.
  - Translate technical jargons and use analogies.
  - Maintain and share a brief periodic project status report based on agreed upon template.


How do you ensure code hygiene and delivery quality?
How do you ensure the application scalability?
Suppose, there is a implementation for which there is no existing library/logic on your machine, how will you approach this problem statement?
How will you address a production issue?
What changes you will do to your app's current architecture?

Can you describe a situation where you had to resolve a conflict within your team?
Can you discuss a time when you had to bridge communication gaps between technical and non-technical team members?
How do you facilitate knowledge sharing and cross-functional collaboration within your team?
How do you approach problem-solving when faced with complex technical challenges?
How do you prioritize tasks and allocate resources in a software development project?
Can you discuss your familiarity with software testing methodologies and best practices?
How do you approach architectural design and system scalability in software development projects?
Can you discuss a time when you had to make a difficult decision in a software development project?
