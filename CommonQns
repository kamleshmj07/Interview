Tell us about yourself:
  - I'm currently working as a lead software engineer with finalyca technologies ltd. Total work experience is 9+ years
  - I have 7+ years of experience in the alternative asset management industry, 
    where I've had the opportunity to work on various projects related to portfolio management,
    quant research, client services, pricing valuation, post trade reconcilliation, analytics.
  - I have worked on multiple programming languages. With C#, Python and SQL lies most of my exposure.

Day to day activity or Roles and Responsibilities:
  - Individual contribution
  - Task management
  - Sprint planning and execution
  - Code review
  - Discussions around requirements and implementation

Why are you looking for a change?
  - I've realized that there's a significant cultural misalignment between myself and my current organization.
    I respect the company's values and vision, although I believe that I would thrive better in an environment that 
    aligns more closely with my own working style.
  - I like to research and experiment not always thinking about the alpha. Implementation with potential to scale by planning ahead is what I have enjoyed.
