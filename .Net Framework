    - Common Engine to compile all the .Net aware languages.
    - Cross language integration.
    
>> What is CLR ?
    - CLR is a runtime environment which compliles the code in the MSIL and then further transalates to byte code.
    - CLR also takes care of the number of other things like memory management, security checks, co-ordinating threads and application hosting.
    
>> What is CLS and CTS ?
    - The CTS specification fully describes all possible data types and all programming constructs supported by the runtime,
      specifies how these entities can interact with each other.
    - The CLS, is a related specification that defines a subset of common types and programming constructs that all .NET programming languages can agree on.

>> What is Managed or Unmanaged Code?
    - The Code that is developed under the .Net Framework and also executed with the help of CLR is called Managed code.
    - Applications that do not run under the control of the CLR are said to be Unmanaged code.
