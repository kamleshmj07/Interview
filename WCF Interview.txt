>> Windows Communication Foundation	
	- WCF is a unification technology which unites the following technologies:
		1] NET remoting
		2] MSMQ
		3] Web services
		4] COM+
	- WCF we need to 
		1] Creating a service (WCF Library with Service Configuration)
	 	2] Hosting a service (Website >> WCF Service >> SVC >> Codebehind)
	 	3] Consuming a service (Add Service Reference i.e. Wsdl link)
	
>> Service Library (SL) vs Service Application (SA)
	- SL contains Interfaces and Classes
	- SA contains SL dll and is used for hosting with use of end points.
	
>> EndPoints
	- WCF Service is a program that exposes a collection of Endpoints. 
	- Each Endpoint is a portal itself for communicating with the world.
	- End point consists of three components.
	- A : Address (192.168.10.10)
	  B : Bindings (http, net.tcp, net.pipe, net.msmq)
	  C : Contracts (Interfaces and methods)
	
	<system.serviceModel>
		<services>
			<service name="MulService">
				<endpoint address="http://xxxxx" binding="MyBinding" contract="MulServiceLibrary.IMulService"
				behaviorConfiguration="MyBehavior" />
			</service>
		</services>
		<behaviors>
			<serviceBehaviors>
				<behavior name="MyBehavior">
					<serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled = "true" />
				</behavior>
			</serviceBehaviors>
		</behaviors>
	</system.serviceModel>
	
>> SelfHosting : Used for writing the code in C# to host wcf service, used for debugging.

>> Bindings
	- Binding defines the channel used to communicate with the EndPoint or Service.
	- Client communicates with the Service via Messages.
	- Messages flow via different stages :
		1] Protocol Channel
			a. Transaction Protocol - Gives option to implement a logic inside a Transaction.
			b. Reliable Messaging - Gives option to receive acknowledgement from the service.
			c. Security Protocol - Transport Security and Message Security.
		2] Transport Channel
			a. Message Encoder - Gives option to encode and send messages.
			b. Transport Protocol - The protocol we need to select or choose for sending messages.
	- Frequently used bindings in project : http, wshttp, net.tcp

>> Types of Bindings : 
	1] BasicHttpBinding
		+ This binding uses HTTP as the transport and text/XML as the default message encoding.
		+ Security is disabled by default.
		+ This binding does not support WS-* functionalities like WS- Addressing, WS-Security, WS-ReliableMessaging
	2] WSHttpBinding
		+ Defines a secure, reliable, interoperable binding suitable for non-duplex service contracts.
		+ It supports WS-* functionality and distributed transactions with reliable and secure sessions using SOAP security.
		+ It uses HTTP and HTTPS transport for communication.
		+ Reliable sessions are disabled by default.
	3] WSDualHttpBinding
		+ This binding is same as that of WSHttpBinding, except it supports duplex service. Duplex service is a service which uses duplex message pattern, which allows service to communicate with client via callback.
		+ In WSDualHttpBinding reliable sessions are enabled by default. It also supports communication via SOAP intermediaries.
		
		
>> WS-* is shorthand for the the myriad of specifications that are used for web service messaging.
	Some of the services are:

	WS-Security
	WS-SecureConversation
	WS-Federation
	WS-Authorization
	WS-Policy
	WS-Trust
	WS-Privacy
	WS-Test
		
>> Different Contracts in WCF
	- [ServiceContract] : Applied on service interface. Describes the operations a service performs.
	- [OperationContract] : Applied on the service method. Describes the operations a service performs.
	- [DataContract] : Used on the complex type for passing/receiving the same complex type to/from the OperationContract.
	- [FaultContract] : Describes errors raised by the service and how the errors will be handled and propogated to the clients.
	- Message Contracts : Passing message for passing specific formats.

>> Message Contracts
	- WCF uses SOAP message for communication. In SOAP, WCF allows to customize the message header & define the security for header and body of the message.
	- If a type has both Message and Data contract, service operation will accept only message contract.
	- Rules :
		a] When using Message contract type as parameter, Only one parameter can be used in service Operation
				[OperationContract]
				void SaveEmployeeDetails(EmployeeDetails emp);
		
		b] Service operation either should return Messagecontract type or it should not return any value
				[OperationContract]
				EmployeeDetails GetEmployeeDetails();
		
		c] Service operation will accept and return only message contract type. Other data types are not allowed.
				[OperationContract]
				EmployeeDetails ModifyEmployeeDetails(EmployeeDetails emp);
	- MessageHeaderArray Attribute : http://wcftutorial.net/MessageHeaderArray-Attribute.aspx
	
>> FaultContract

>> Instance Management
	- Basically there are three instance modes in WCF:
		1] Per-Call instance mode
			+ When WCF service is configured for Per-Call instance mode, 
			  Service instance will be created for each client request. 
			  This Service instance will be disposed after response is sent back to client. 
			+ http://www.wcftutorial.net/Per-Call-Service.aspx
		2] Per-Session instance mode
			+ When client creates new proxy to particular service instance, 
			  a dedicated service instance will be provided to the client.
		3] Singleton Instance Mode
			+ All clients are independently connected to the same single instance.
	- Instance mode can be configured using ServiceBehavior attribute.
		[ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.Single)]
		
>> Instance Deactivation in WCF
	- The service instance is basically hosted in a context.
	- Session actually correlated the client message not to the instance of the service, but session is related to the context of the service host.
	- On the session starts, the host creates a new context and when session ends, the context is terminated.
	- By default, the lifetime of the context is the same as that of the instance it hosts.
	- For optimization purposes, WCF provides the option of separating the two lifetimes and deactivating the instance separately from its context.
	- RealeaseInstanceMode.None
	  RealeaseInstanceMode.BeforeCall
	  RealeaseInstanceMode.AfterCall
	  RealeaseInstanceMode.BeforeAndAfterCall
