>> Windows Communication Foundation	
	- WCF is a unification technology which unites the following technologies:
		1] NET remoting
		2] MSMQ
		3] Web services
		4] COM+
	- WCF we need to 
		1] Creating a service (WCF Library with Service Configuration)
	 	2] Hosting a service (Website >> WCF Service >> SVC >> Codebehind)
	 	3] Consuming a service (Add Service Reference i.e. Wsdl link)
	
>> Service Library (SL) vs Service Application (SA)
	- SL contains Interfaces and Classes
	- SA contains SL dll and is used for hosting with use of end points.
	
>> EndPoints
	- WCF Service is a program that exposes a collection of Endpoints. 
	- Each Endpoint is a portal itself for communicating with the world.
	- End point consists of three components.
	- A : Address (192.168.10.10)
	  B : Bindings (http, net.tcp, net.pipe, net.msmq)
	  C : Contracts (Interfaces and methods)
	
	<system.serviceModel>
		<services>
			<service name="MulService">
				<endpoint address="http://xxxxx" binding="MyBinding" contract="MulServiceLibrary.IMulService"
				behaviorConfiguration="MyBehavior" />
			</service>
		</services>
		<behaviors>
			<serviceBehaviors>
				<behavior name="MyBehavior">
					<serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled = "true" />
				</behavior>
			</serviceBehaviors>
		</behaviors>
	</system.serviceModel>
	
>> SelfHosting : Used for writing the code in C# to host wcf service, used for debugging.

>> Bindings
	- Binding defines the channel used to communicate with the EndPoint or Service.
	- Client communicates with the Service via Messages.
	- Messages flow via different stages :
		1] Protocol Channel
			a. Transaction Protocol - Gives option to implement a logic inside a Transaction.
			b. Reliable Messaging - Gives option to receive acknowledgement from the service.
			c. Security Protocol - Transport Security and Message Security.
		2] Transport Channel
			a. Message Encoder - Gives option to encode and send messages.
			b. Transport Protocol - The protocol we need to select or choose for sending messages.
	- Frequently used bindings in project : http, wshttp, net.tcp

>> Different Contracts in WCF
	- [ServiceContract] : Applied on service interface. Describes the operations a service performs.
	- [OperationContract] : Applied on the service method. Describes the operations a service performs.
	- [DataContract] : Used on the complex type for passing/receiving the same complex type to/from the OperationContract.
	- [FaultContract] : Describes errors raised by the service and how the errors will be handled and propogated to the clients.
	- Message Contracts : Passing message for passing specific formats.

>> Message Contracts
	- WCF uses SOAP message for communication. In SOAP, WCF allows to customize the message header & define the security for header and body of the message.
	- If a type has both Message and Data contract, service operation will accept only message contract.
	- Rules :
		a] When using Message contract type as parameter, Only one parameter can be used in service Operation
				[OperationContract]
				void SaveEmployeeDetails(EmployeeDetails emp);
		
		b] Service operation either should return Messagecontract type or it should not return any value
				[OperationContract]
				EmployeeDetails GetEmployeeDetails();
		
		c] Service operation will accept and return only message contract type. Other data types are not allowed.
				[OperationContract]
				EmployeeDetails ModifyEmployeeDetails(EmployeeDetails emp);
