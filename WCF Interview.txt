	- WCF is a unification technology which unites the following technologies:
		1]NET remoting
		2]MSMQ
		3]Web services
		4]COM+
	- WCF we need to 
		1] Creating a service (WCF Library with Service Configuration)
	 	2] Hosting a service (Website >> WCF Service >> SVC >> Codebehind)
	 	3] Consuming a service (Add Service Reference i.e. Wsdl link)

>> Different Contracts in WCF
	- [ServiceContract] : Applied on service interface.
	- [OperationContract] : Applied on the service method.
	- [DataContract] : Used on the complex type for passing the same complex type as a parameter in the OperationContract.
	
>> Service Library (SL) vs Service Application (SA)
	- SL contains Interfaces and Classes
	- SA contains SL dll and is used for hosting with use of end points.
	
>> EndPoints
	- Also called as ABCs of service.
	- A : Address (192.168.10.10)
	  B : Bindings (http, net.tcp, net.pipe, net.msmq)
	  C : Contracts (Interfaces and methods)
