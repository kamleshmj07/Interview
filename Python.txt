First Class Objects
  - In Python, functions are first class objects which means that functions in Python can be used or passed as arguments.
  - Properties of first class functions:
      A function is an instance of the Object type.
      You can store the function in a variable.
      You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
      You can return the function from a function.
      You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, …

Decorators : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decorators-in-python/
  - Decorators are a part of Python’s metaprogramming which are used to add additional functionality to existing code without altering the original structure at compile time. 
  - In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.
  
Generators : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generators-in-python/
  - A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. 
  - If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.





















Python OOP Questions:
---------------------
Class
  - It is a complex but logical data type defined with a unique state and behavior

Object
  - It is an instance of a class representing a unique state which may or may not differentiate it's behavior from other objects of same class

The self
  - self represents the instance of the class.
  - By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python.

The __init__ method : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/__init__-in-python/
  - This method acts as a constructor for class
  - It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated

Inheritance
  - Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
  - Types of Inheritance
      1] Single Inheritance:
          Single-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class.

      2] Multilevel Inheritance:
          Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class.

      3] Hierarchical Inheritance:
          Hierarchical level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.

      4] Multiple Inheritance:
          Multiple level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class.

Python Coding Programs:
-----------------------
#------------------------------ A simple generator for Fibonacci Numbers
def fib(limit):
      
    # Initialize first two Fibonacci Numbers 
    a, b = 0, 1
  
    # One by one yield next Fibonacci Number
    while a < limit:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
  
# Create a generator object
x = fib(5)
  
# Iterating over the generator object using next
print(x.next()) # In Python 3, __next__()
print(x.next())
print(x.next())
print(x.next())
print(x.next())
  
# Iterating over the generator object using for
# in loop.
print("\nUsing for in loop")
for i in fib(5): 
    print(i)
